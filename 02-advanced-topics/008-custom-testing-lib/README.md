> writing a simple library to test your Lambda function

## Description
Illustrates how to write a simple testing library `test/simple-lambda.js` that includes the definition of an event object and the provision of a simple `context` object that features the `succeed`, `fail` and `done` methods. Then, the library calls the source code to test it.
This simple idea can be easily improved.
